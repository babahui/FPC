# Dynamic Feature Pruning and Consolidation for Occluded Person Re-Identification [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14742.pdf)

The *official* repository for  [Dynamic Feature Pruning and Consolidation for Occluded Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14742.pdf) achieves state-of-the-art performances on occluded person re-ID.

## News
- 2023.3  FPC's code will be released coming soon.
- 2023.11We first updated part of the evaluation code, and we will continue updating.
